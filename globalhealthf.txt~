I've had a cold, and if I don't prepare myself a little soup, nobody will do anything for me!... I have an obsession with my kids - I can't have any more, but I would have done if I could...The day when they become independent and have their own lives, I don't want them to lose their family links, because I didn't have that...I want to be a matriarch, in a positive sense...I'd like them to come home for Christmas, birthdays etc. - I mean I do care about health and all that, but my family is an obsession.  People will tell you I'm obsessive, I want to control everyone, but that's the way I am...- Health...family...work?  Nobody's mentioned work... - We're not very materialistic - if you don't have your health to enjoy the money... - health and balance... - feeling loved, especially... affection... - balances linked to family and physical and mental health- I feel balance is important for health.  You're always thinking about what you want to do, what you should do, your family...Balance in that sense... You might feel very anxious or have a lot of concern - you continually have to think about things, question things, that's what I mean... So health is a prerequisite, because you can't do other things without it... - I know people who aren't healthy, but sometimes they're more balanced, they're stronger - although health is important too... I also know people who are very healthy but don't have that balance... That nothing bad happens to you, you don't suffer from diseases... - Doing exercise, having a healthy diet and so on, but there are things that you don't expect to happen, that you can't foresee... - I see illness all the time in my job, I'm a pharmacist... I don't look after myself, I'm a heavy smoker... - I smoke too... - I'm concerned about my children, so I want to care for them...- I worry about what I see, but of course you're toughened to it... Sometimes my family say 'you talk about diseases like it's nothing', but it's my job... - Are we talking about leading a healthy lifestyle or health?... One thing strengthens the other - if you lead a healthy lifestyle, then you strengthen your health... But there are some things you can't help, diseases... - I prefer not to think about that... I mean there's cancer, and you can't do anything about that, but then if maybe you have back problems and you lose some weight, that could help you... Some people do nothing to help themselves... So not leading a healthy lifestyle, drinking a lot and so on... I think most people generally look after themselves...- I said balance... - I'd say quality of life...- Balance is related to wellbeing... - I think we look after ourselves based on the opportunities available to us..-  I think being fit is not being obsessed, not being too thin, not being anorexic or obese, just having certain healthy habits... - I think fitness is more for men than women... being in the gym all day, taking supplements... - But that isn't fitness - I see it as physical exercise, having a good diet. -  You don't need to take anything to be fit - and I work in a pharmacy!... - Being fit is not having dinner, for example, it's having a cereal bar...- That's terrible!... Fitness is more external... It's like having stamina, that's fitness... - I think it's a person who'll go cycling, won't smoke -  it's about stamina... - For me it's people who go to the gym... it's not one of my great concerns...- Mental-physical balance... - Family balance...- Health.. - Harmony or something like that...- something spiritual...  - Feeling well.- At night.  - At 2, 3am - where are my kids?  What are they doing? Have they done out for dinner?  Are they drinking?  It gets to 5am and I seriously think about calling the police... - At least in my case I try to look after myself every day, but I go out with friends, I'll have a croissant and I'll really enjoy it... - I try to look after my diet nearly every day - fish, good fish... I don't like fried things or greasy or fatty foods, so we don't normally have those at home...- I like to look after myself, but that doesn't mean I won't have a pork stew now and again... - Things at work like sitting in a certain way so you don't damage yourself ,these are things that have come in over the years.  We weren't worried about these things before... - Now what are young people concerned about?  Studies or work... - Exactly - I wasn't worried about health ten years ago, but over the years, especially when you're a mother, it becomes more important... When you go shopping and have to climb stairs, you realised you aren't as strong...- Ten years ago I wasn't so worried about whether my partner would leave me, or I wasn't healthy, but nowadays maybe I will be concerned about these things.  What if I end up alone? You ask yourself, how could I bear that situation?- Well, yes, but you have to try not to let that imbalance you.  You have to say that if my partner left me, I wouldn't let that imbalance me, I'd just go along and do what I could... - Jobs also imbalance you a lot, there's a lot of fierce competition, so there are a lot of moments in work when you don't feel balanced...- Yes, distress...Anguish... - Yes, my distress maybe started 5 years ago because of loneliness.  Maybe 10-15 years ago I wasn't worried about that... - You look around you and you see lots of people who are in distress in some way... You see lots of men, too, with drinking problems, or who like betting or whatever - that isn't being very balanced... - We feel more distressed but at the same time we say 'this can't imbalance me'... - I started to feel concerned about all this maybe 22 years ago.  - The stress flows now, you feel concerned about your children... Like I was saying before, I worry about my children at maybe 5am when they're not home and I wonder if anything's happened to them.  And my husband's sleeping so peacefully!- No, it's about worrying about their health, and drugs and so on.  And even if they've just gone out for dinner, are they having a burger or what?... What do these kids aspire to?  What about their futures?  They're repeating exams and do they care?  You go to psychologists and they say 'they're fine, they're really happy'... I'm more worried about them than myself, whether they're having dinner or not... I think you get more worried as you get older because of your physical deterioration - you're not worried about these things when you're 25- You have less energy...- Wrinkles... - You obviously get fat...- You're aware you have to look after yourself more to maintain yourself in a good state inside and outside - you don't need to worry about that before... - I don't really care about wrinkles - it's all on the outside - I mean I don't have many right now, but you can tell when everything is sagging... - I think it's the expression on your face that changes.  - When I'm 60 I'd love to continue laughing with my friends and my son, of course - so it's about attitude and good humour... - Unless I have plastic surgery or something I have to continue with the process of aging... - These things also increase your distress in one way or another, when you see yourself changing... - It's not distress, really... - Well, somewhat distress... - No, not me - I don't feel distressed because of white hair and wrinkles and cellulite!  Sometimes I feel distressed or depressed and sad because I want to get on well with my family, and I think that influences health and wellbeing... I used to be a very extroverted person, but now I have a lot more concerns about my children.  I wasn't even really worried about them when they were babies, apart from the routine concerns, but now I sometimes just feel really miserable, and that undermines your health inside...  And sometimes I say, I'm going down, you know?... You feel concerned about everything: if they've finished their studies, if they're going out too much or whatever.  All of us have had supermothers who would just live for our sake, you know... - But I don't think our mums were so involved as we are now - they were more like housewives, they'd do the cooking, the laundry, the ironing, and so on... - But we're paying so much attention when the kids are young, you won't sleep, you're bending over, your back hurts, getting up and so on... - There's an age when it's great because you don't have those problems any more, but then your mind starts working - those little problems when they're older.  And it undermines your health... - And husbands too...- Yes, husbands!  Write that down: husbands!... - Affection is fundamental... If you have no affection, if a person doesn't love you, then you feel bad- Yes... We don't know to what extent... we have more responsibilities so we have more reasons to be concerned... - maybe one day the human race will mature and there'll be no need to be concerned... - My mother's always just there, by my ear... - I think maybe one day we'll not need to be concerned... - I don't think so... I think it's balance again, trying to maintain balance... - You're more aware of health and things.... You're aware of more... Like wrinkles, you need to take care of that and you do what you can... - Now as women we have more information about what's happening in society, we're more trained, we know about things, we know about the world...and also mass media, more information...- If you want it you'll look for it, but otherwise you'll receive it... - We receive it, for example in magazines - and it could be good or bad information... - There is some information which I doubt, because you read a book and it tells you something, but it doesn't take place in practice at all... like before they told us sunflower seeds for cholesterol, but not any more... Now it's Spanish ham or red wine... Now it's the other way around... it's a bit contradictory, like you have to put babies upside down or face down, then after a few years it's the other way...- With information about health, you don't always know if it's well researched... - You believe all the information that's published... - TV and friends are also sources of information... - Breakfast television... - So much information has created an excessive level of demand, we're demanding so many things for our children... - I don't think that level of demand is good for emotional balance... - I demand lots of things, a supermother.... - You create such a high level of demand - our grandmothers wouldn't have done that... My mother was happy, my grandmother was happy... Slow down your pace of life - when you see your doctor you're anxious, and they give you 'Lexotin' or whatever, the usual stuff... For every 50... no, 100 packs of Lexotin sold, just one is for a man... Whoever doesn't have a cleaner has to do it themselves, you have to cook and everything... I have to get up and look after the baby, and my husband's there sleeping, and then if I want to go to the gym in the morning, I'm just too tired... - We work inside and out... - You care for yourself as much as you can, but society wants us to be divine, you know... They're lying to you, they say you take an Actimel and you'll feel full of energy, but I have one and I feel just the same... You can eat forty sausages, but if you eat one of these margarines that reduce cholesterol, then it will take away the cholesterol on its own... I mean come on... They're deceiving you...- Yes... You say to yourself, I have high cholesterol, so I'll have this bread and sausage, and then in the evening I'll have this margarine... They tell you all this, they give you this information... You think my grandma lived much better... You have all this information but it makes you more distressed- When I go shopping I say 'I'm going to buy healthy things', like this lightbulb that comes on in your mind that says 'hey, I'm not going to buy chocolate with donuts' - it's a temptation... I mean like Christmas - we eat so much, and then on the 8th Jan you stop doing things.  Not just because you're gaining weight, but because you're tired, so I won't eat any prepared dishes...- I never have ready made food in my freezer... - Not buying sweets or chocolate... - Trying to buy fresh food in the market rather than the supermarket... - Buying fresh produce like fish they cut right there in front of you... - yes I agree... - I have semi-skimmed milk or calcium enriched milk... - Taking soya, and the same for my children... - I try to make my children have good habits, like eating fresh vegetables... Mediterranean diet, beans, fish vegetables...- Fish, fruit... - My husband used to have really high cholesterol, so I made a diet for both of us... - Skimmed milk and yoghurts... Fruit, vegetables and fish, and from time to time some meat... Salads with Extra Virgin Olive oil... Rice, that's Mediterranean... It's something I have in mind but I don't always follow it- Macaroni... Lot's of times you wont be able to do what you should, like if you have to eat out you wont follow that diet... I try to have that in mind when I go shopping... - I do it, because I don't always go out to eat... - Sometimes you can't avoid going out... - I know people aged 35 who are having heart problems... - I know a lot of young people who have heart problems... - I try to look after my husband, I've been doing it for 4 years, it's a hereditary problem, poor thing - he can't eat so many things because of the cholesterol... - I won't eat bio foods... Just natural yoghurt from Danone and apples...- I never have any cheese at home- Something from Danone which is pink... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's for your skin... How frivolous!  A product that's gonna give you good skin... - That's from Danone... That's frivolous?  It might be ok for some people... - but maybe if you put it on your skin, that's another thing, but eating it?... Well maybe for some people it's important, but I think it's frivolous... - Well the cholesterol stuff is targeted at men, and for women there's soya stuff, sanitary pads... Women urinate but men don't, or what?... - I mean you eat a yoghurt and you get rid of your wrinkles?- Not eating them compulsively... - You don't believe in them but you buy them... - Yes... well if they're skimmed, then they're less fatty, so you're putting less fat into your body - that's good... I mean there are no magic formulas, but I do think that they help you... - A normal, common person... - I've got  friend and he's the typical, takes all the natural products, all the fruit and nuts and so on, does lots of exercise, and he's SO skinny!  Such a tiny little thing!  Just skin on him and that's it!  And he always gets cold - more than me!  And his knees are just like mine.  He's obsessed, and he's gonna look terrible, skinny looking -  if we go and have a beer, he'll have milk or water.  You open up his cupboard and he's a model - wholemeal cookies, etc., does lots of exercise - everything... - This is the one that overdoes it, the one who's always weightlifting... - Physical appearance is also important- It's a man more than a woman... - very very skinny... - A bit nervous... - A man who wants to look divine, a metrosexual...- No, no no!  It's not metrosexual.  He's sick!  He's sad!... - Very gloomy...- No, no, no - he thinks he is... He only focuses on what he's concerned about - diet, health... - So thin, very sad and gloomy, always looking at yoghurts... - Poor thing, poor thing - you feel pity for them... - I think they're imbalanced, a bit crazy... They focus all their energy on that- Well it all depends on their age.  If they're a teenager then that's normal... - I think it's a typical fat guy, sweating... - It's a man.. - Yes, he's got a bigger belly... - He's happy... - Well, he isn't really happy, he's a conformist... - He's simple... - Dresses a bit carelessly... Can't even button his suit up, stains on it, typical man... But there can be two types: the really careless man, or the good, calm guy - He's nice... - He has a great time... - No complexes... - Lots of friends...- Really joyful and talkative, lots of friends... - Doesn't flirt so much but he's the funny guy from the group...- Not attractive, more like a friend - a good guy who can tell you jokes...- Balanced, that's where balance lies... - No not me, no way - not at all... - I think it's a woman... - This is somebody like us, the one that's concerned... - I think there are more and more men like that... - It could be a woman... - A normal, common person... - It's a woman, but there could be more and more men there as well... - Looks clean, well-educated... - I think she's physically better than us... - I don't know about that!.... - I think it's an above average woman, cute, middle aged... It's a normal woman, one who goes shopping... - But she has distress, demands...- Yes... She needs to go to a spa... - She needs to get relaxed and be treated like a queen... But that's temporary - she needs to find a partner to share- It's a man who goes shopping, gets involved... So he's involved in education, in shopping, you can give him the shopping list, he can do cooking for you.  - He thinks for himself- I think the heart... It's the body's engine, the most important thing... - Calcium for the bones, the back, the menopause - for men it's more cholesterol... - Cardiovascular things... For men it's basically cholesterol... - And also regular breast check-up...- Well of course I'm also concerned about that, but it's not a typical stress...- I think you become more concerned when you have a pain or something, but if you're ok... - I'm also concerned about cancer... - Yes.... - Your skin, your hair- No, it depends what aches you have... - Well, yeah, because it's every day that you have that... - I think we're more concerned about the outer part than the inner part, until things emerge on the inside...- No - not until it starts hurting you.  - Right now, I'm not concerned about any part of my body... - I'm very concerned about stress... - Yes, the brain never stops... That's fundamental, always thinking about what we're going to do today, tomorrow, what's going to happen for dinner and about your job and everything- Vitamin supplements... Actimel- Doctors say it's good for you... it does activate your defences... - But I got an email saying exactly the opposite... - Yeah, but that's the Internet... - It reinforces you, doesn't it?  Stress and things weaken your immune system and this helps... - I take it in stages...I don't really know what it does but I still take it... - It's delicious... I take it in the mornings... - Yeah, I take it after I get up... And you just drink it, it's so convenient... - It's delicious, I've tried it... - It's very expensive... - yes, expensive- It goes in stages with me... - I think they reinforce you, too... - For your skin... - Especially skin...- I've asked doctors and they've told me not to take any vitamins if I follow a good diet- If I've had blood tests done and everything's ok, I'm not going to take something I don't need... - Just to prevent...- It's because of your age... - I take normal milk - it already has calcium- Reduces cholesterol... - I have it for flavour... - Omega- This goes in stages - right now I'm not taking any of these skimmed and bio products.  It depends how much you want to look after yourself- No, I don't go in stages... - It depends.  You might realise you're looking a bit big around the waist... - In springtime and summer, when you've been covering up your body... - When you buy new clothes... - And then in winter you're cold- I have pistachio... - I have nuts - not every day, but I have them at home all the time... - I like almonds - in salads they're really nice... seasoned pine tree fruits... If you take them three times a day you can regulate your cholesterol...-  Legumes- Beans... - The fibre's very important, and they're very easy to cook... - I don't do that because it's easy to cook, but they're good for iron if you've got anaemia... - They're part of the Mediterranean diet... Your grandma used to cook them- And fish....- fresh cheese... - fresh fruit juices... - vegetables... lots of broccoli because it contains lots of iron...it depends on the season, I like fruits in season, because the oranges in summer don't taste as good... - Red meat... - veal... good wine.... - Bread- I don't have wine every day, but I think it's good for you... - I don't have wine, I have beer, but I think that's also good for you- My husband takes Danacol for blood pressure- The margarine we mentioned - the Flora... - Soya products... - Yeah that's true... For older women- Actimel... Danacol... That advert where it says Pascual works - juices...-  Pascual milk... Danacol...-  Pascual... Danone...- Pascual... Danone... Nestle...- I don't think Nestle...- Well, fibre cereals and so on...- Yes, Nestle... Kellogg's... Flora... Pascual... Danone...- Kaiko, a cholesterol product... Kellogg's...- Danone is the one with more products, and then Pascual...- I think they're more or less at the same level, but the Pascual adverts are so horrible...- I think Danone has more, and then Kellogg's with their cereals...- Traditional products... - Confidence...- Wide variety... price... confidence... traditional...innovative... that pink thing they launched...- Wide range of products- The protagonist of the party... - the leader... - The film with John Travolta, Saturday Night Fever, where he's dancing - I imagined something like him- I can't remember any advert or anything... - confidence and quality...- it's more expensive... - lots of milk... - strange adverts - that gets your attention... - they look very dull, the adverts - really common... I can't recall them... - prestige though in terms of quality... - I think it's classical, with a suit... - Danone is more classical... - Danone's very young- American quality, American... - Slim and nice... - That girl eating that bowl in the morning is so divine and beautiful - no way!  That's physically impossible, eating that massive bowl and being like that!  I just don't believe it!... We don't have time to sit down and eat breakfast... A feminine product, more targeted at women than men... And for kids, but not for men... - I like them but I get the impression I'm not going to enjoy them... You need some relaxation that you don't have to enjoy them in the morning - they're delicious and I'd love to have time to enjoy them, but I don't... I eat the chocolate ones that my kids eat - I know I should eat the wholegrain ones, but I don't like them... I see it as a broom in your digestive tract... Young... I don't have them to enjoy them - at least the wholegrain ones... They're very good... I take lots of the Special K ones... - Most of you are talking about breakfast, but I have them for dinner with yoghurt, and I love them.  You can have them for dinner with yoghurt... -Like a Zumosol cousin... Vigorous... Jumpy, energetic... Young... Dynamic... Fit... Doesn't want to gain weight... He's twentysomething... Could be a man or a woman... He isn't obsessed, he also eats delicious things, not just oats - he's the character in the middle... - If I buy cereals from this brand they're delicious, I think they're better quality... In reality it isn't targeted at us-  I think the adverts are unrealistic... I don't identify with the commercial, it's for young girls- Maybe you won't have cereals every day, but you will have milk...-  Danone is the daily product... - Very American, in a negative sense - before McDonalds and after McDonalds, poor thing...-  They could be Spanish... It's very extreme...-  She's not bad, she looks happy...- It seems as if they're saying if you follow this diet and take these pills or whatever, you'll end up like this...-  That's just a cliché - come on, a product would never do that...-  That's exaggerated, extreme...-  This image doesn't fit for a product...- 4....- 5...- 4...- 5...- 5...- The plant maybe...-  That's nature...-  The bean...-  Look, the artist, maybe - it can imply balance- I think it's future, joy...-  It gets to you more... More human... Humanity... Young people... party... love... relationships...-  I just see old people and young people - two extremes...nobody from our age group, just old people and young people...we're not there...-  I can see my children's future but not ours...-  I can see the university my kid's gonna be at in a few years...-  I see humanity because of the hands together and the couple... healthy...there's a lot of affection there...- They're eating...-  They're daily scenes...-  The images of the hands are closer to us...-  The images of the hands call your attention positively...-  It's like a deal, closing a deal...-  It's like I've just met you - pleased to meet you...-  That one's like clapping, look- Are they Chinese?  Wait... I don't care whether they're Chinese or not...-  Take that away because he's not eating and we're saying you should eat...Chips and ketchup, we don't want that one...-  The hands and the couple - we'll keep that one...-  The grandparents, yes...No, not those...- They've got their hands under the sun... - We're talking about feelings, affection, love...I like that, it motivates me a lot... It's got to do with wellbeing...Especially emotional wellbeing... and physical, too...emotional like when you get your degree and that focuses you more...-  I don't like that one at all...-  me neither... she looks superficial...I do like the mother and the kid... It's more sex and fashion...sex....partners...- 8...- 6...- 7...- 7 or 8...- Maybe we are missing...- They're not our age group...- The couple looks very young...- Maybe the age group is missing...- Families- 2...- 2... I like the girl there, but not the overall image, not for this theme, this context...-  I like that picture because it's suggestive...-  The piercing...-  I don't like the high-heeled shoes because they're unhealthy...- the pregnant woman - I like that one... Not that picture, I don't think that's very maternal...- I like the guy, he has a nice torso, like a chocolate bar - I mean, come on, not even Nestle does that... but that girl with the helmet looks cute...- It's frivolous...it's very warm but aggressive...I don't feel identified at all...maybe I'd like to get identified with THAT guy!-  Shall we leave the guy with the great body?...- Yes...We can omit him if you like...- No, I don't care, if he's got that body...I prefer the feet...that guy and those girls are like that because they eat certain things...- Well that guy's healthy, isn't he?...- That's because he's going to the gym, and it says sex, and he's taking anabolic steroids...- I can't see sex there...I can see sex there, that guy's very attractive...- I like the feet...I mean if they're that guy's feet there... it's possibly something that we see as distant - we've already had our wedding and stuff...but this hasn't got anything to do with wellbeing, you know - I mean you don't have to get married to do that... I want a handsome guy- Exactly...-  But there's the desire to see attractive guys- Worse...- Worse...- Yes, worse...this is conveying sex - it's full of these images...- I get a pleasant sensation, it's like my mind is receiving pleasant images...But I see sex on the board...- A newly married couple...- He's showing his bum, you know...the red girl's provocative- How sporty!...-  Sports, sports...-  Is it women dancing at the top?...- Bride dancing at a wedding and then it's Christmas...vitality, activity...fitness....joy...movement...this is the right direction - better than the previous one...- Better than the previous one, yeah...they make an effort, a mental effort as well...travellers who like the open air...sports...- I don't understand the Christmas part there at the top - that's not related to sports...- I'd like to omit the Christmas tree because that's something different...and risky sports, extreme sports - the car and the bike...-  Parachuting?-   Could be ok...- Is that New York?-   Or Tokyo maybe?-   No, the taxis are yellow...- Yes...- Yes...- It's very colourful - bright colours- Oooh, lots of calories - she's weightlifting...- Too much sacrifice, all that exercise...-  Those are professionals, you know - she's wearing her glasses, she can she everything...- And that guy's professional, too... - Oh, I don't know about the one who's horseriding...- Yeah, like going to the gym...- Yes, or the one that's running or jogging...- That could be okay...- The one that's doing gym exercise, but not the weightlifting     -     So there's a tree on the left...     -     I think that's a cruise ship around Egypt...     -     That's Benidorm!     -     I don't like it at all-  it's completely distant...     -     Those men wearing those necklaces - that's a horrible picture...     -     It has nothing to do with health...     -     That picture with the grandfather and the grandchild is fine, and the tree...But I don't like that one... A lot of bark... The end of your life, the end of the holidays... Peter Pan who doesn't wanna grow up...    -      Olive trees...Egypt...distance...    -      This is longevity?...No, no, no - that's sad... It doesn't connect with my daily life... If you're gonna be 98 and end up in a wheelchair, then no way - you'd rather die at 60... everyone wants to live a healthy life...   -     The one's about daily life social relationships are much better than this one...    -     This is the one I least like... I don't feel closely identified with this one... It has to go gradually... It makes you think of the future- Oh this one's very spiritual...- Very trance-like...yoga...candles- You can see peace, but peace that's very difficult to achieve - very spiritual.-  It's very distant, very far away...-  I'd like to feel like that woman but it's impossible - that's not my life... I'd have to leave my family... That would be another life, leaving my family... I don't even want that - that's like floating, and I want to feel things!  I want life!  I don't want so much tranquillity!-   You want sexuality or emotion or affection...-  Yes exactly... I'd be happy going for something like that, a more relaxed life...-  Nothing's absolute - affection, sexuality, balance with yourself.  People tell me I should do yoga.  I want to disconnect.  At my age I want to do these things more... In spite of the hunk over there...-  If you have a very stressful life, we're going to shorten our lives...that's too extreme- But I don't wanna transform into anything, I want to stay the person I am...-  It doesn't convey that well enough... I don't want to transform myself... Well, some things maybe, but not in general- Sports...energy...life...quality...- Enjoying life...vitality...- Enjoying life...intense sensations...- The hands...friendship, love, affection...with your friends and partner...- Happiness, joy...- Companionship...- Sensuality...sexuality...- Couples...and children, because it's related- I like that one, with the cruise ship...- That one, sensations, life...- But that one's missing friendship...- Let's include intensity in  there - not a boring daily life...- You also want sensations, so put colour into it...
