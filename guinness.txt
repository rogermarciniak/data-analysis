one team dominates the game of rugby the all blacksrivals surrender before a ball is even kickedand that's your fate today the munster team was toldand away come the all blacks all the confidence in the worldbut none of them listenednot even their smallest playerwith a single tackle he stopped goliath deadout to halfway and every Irishman grew twelve feet tallits a try a draea drop at goalits over munster have wonmunster twelve the all blacks nil
